A simple word cloud generator, based on Fereshteh Karimeddini <fereshteh@rstudio.com> Shiny App.
This App analyses the words content of the Canadian main political parties platform for the federal election 2015. It displays a word cloud where the size of the words is proportional to their frequency and the words are highlighted according to six different topics. Below the word cloud, a histogram displays the words frequencies according to the selection of the user.
The user can choose a Canadian political party in the drop-down menu at the top. To make that choice effective, the user must click on the "Change" button. At any time,the user can change the minimum frequency of words to appear in the cloud and the number of words he/she would like to display in the histogram.
